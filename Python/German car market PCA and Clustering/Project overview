Performing Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering to group cars into segments on the german market.

Data used in the project can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaminh/german-car-insights

The aim of the project is to analyze the german car market. First part of the project is to decrease the number of variables
using Principal Component Analysis to optimize the operating time of the model. Then after creating a new dataset with principal 
components, hierarchical clusterining is performed (namely Ward method), to group cars on the market into clusters, which would help
car salesmen in germany offer car alternatives to their clients.
