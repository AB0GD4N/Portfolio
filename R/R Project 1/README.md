1 Using data from Yahoo Finance/stooq/GUS/nbp, download time series of four financial instruments since 2007 (3 stocks, 1 stock index). 

2. build one chart using the dplyr package. we are interested in closing prices. 

3. present the data in properly formatted graphs using the ggplot2 package. Save the graphs using code to a file. 

4 Determine the logarithmic rates of return for each instrument. 

5. calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis) for the rates. Draw a histogram and a quantile-quantile graph with the theoretical graph (formatted appropriately). Save the graphs using code to a file. 

Construct a linear regression model of the form: where 

ri - profit rate of the i-th share
rM - profit rate of the stock index αi, βi - parameters of the equation
ui - random component of i-th share  

Estimate the parameters of the regression model and interpret the parameter.

7 Construct and apply a function to compare dates in two data sets. When inconsistencies in dates are detected, the function assigns the value of the previous day, 0 or the average of adjacent observations depending on the function parameter. 

8 Build and apply a function to compute n averages from generated k element sets from a normal distribution with mean m and standard deviation s. Draw a quantile-quantile plot and histogram for n=100, k=1000, m=2, s=3.5.
